## Pentest and bugbounty tools
Useful things from my pentest-learning-OSCP-failing-brickwall-headbutting journey

[Pentest tools list](https://github.com/6x86/tools/blob/master/pentest_tools.md) \
[Pentest commands list](https://github.com/6x86/tools/blob/master/More_pentest.md) - not as organised as I'd like. \
Bug bounty tools list - ~~second~~ third job, after getting to grips with markdown!
